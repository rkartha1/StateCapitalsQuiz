In this project, the State Capitals Quiz, will test the user’s knowledge of state capital cities in the US. A quiz is composed of 6 questions,
each asking the user to identify a given state’s capital from among 3 choices.
As in the previous project, you will work with fragments, to make your app more flexible. In
addition, you will work with saving and restoring the state of your app. You will also learn how to
work with Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files, SQLite databases, and asynchronous tasks. Finally,
you will further improve your skills in developing apps and utilizing new Android widgets.
The initial data with the US states and their capitals is represented as a CSV file.
